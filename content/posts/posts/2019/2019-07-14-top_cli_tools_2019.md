Summary: On the GitHub project [Awesome Zsh plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins) you can find 1700+ links to plugins, themes, and Zsh plugin managers/frameworks. The number of tools listed on that page is high and it is difficult to get orientation on which plugins gained already a good reputation from the Zsh users community. This post aims at identifying the most popular tools where popularity is measured by the number of stars that Github users added to a given plugin or tool.

Title: Top Popular ZSH Plugins on GitHub (2019)
---

> **NOTE:** This article was written in 2019, for a more recent version of the ranking see: [2023](../top-popular-zsh-plugins-on-github-2023/).
> There is a series of articles dedicated to Zsh plugins: [2018](../top-popular-zsh-plugins-on-github/index.html), [2019](../top-popular-zsh-plugins-on-github-2019/index.html), [2021](../top-popular-zsh-plugins-on-github-2021/index.html), [2023](../top-popular-zsh-plugins-on-github-2023/index.html). The older articles have description of the selected, interesting tools that are not in this article - so you might also to visit the older editions of the survey.

Here is a list of command line tools and Zsh plugins improving the experience when working in text mode. The list was created using resources from [Awesome Zsh plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins). The GitHub collection is called "Zsh plugins" but in fact, it is not strictly limited to Zsh plugins but contains a lot of CLI tools that are not Zsh plugins. I made already a similar list 1.5 years ago - you can find results here: [top zsh plugins](http://safjan.com/articles/posts/top-popular-zsh-plugins-on-github).

On the GitHub project [Awesome Zsh plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins) you can find currently 1700+ links to plugins, themes, and Zsh plugin managers/frameworks. The collection grows in size and gets more and more intimidating for the reader. I decided to filter out tools that are most popular. The popularity is measured with the number of stars that Github users added to given plugin.

# What are Github stars?

Stars is the way how users can 'bookmark' projects - this can serve as indication for others that project successfully grabbed someone's attention. The `stargazers` statistics are available via [GithubAPI](https://developer.github.com/v4/). The metrics is not capturing directly how popular given tool is but I expect, it is a good indication of how well is grabbing attention of Github users. For sake of clarity, I have excluded frameworks, themes, prompts and fonts  that are also listed on "Awesome Zsh plugins" website. The most popular choices excluded from the tools list are posted in the end of this article.
