Title: Rethinking the Link Between Speech and Expertise

Communication is an essential aspect of our lives. It is how we express ourselves, connect with others, and convey our thoughts and ideas. However, not all communication is created equal. We often associate weak speech with low knowledge, lack of experience, and a lack of education, while on the other hand, **flowery and eloquent speech is perceived as a guarantee of education and expertise**.

This assumption is deeply ingrained in our society, and we often judge people based on their ability to speak. However, this is a flawed way of thinking. The quality of one's speech does not necessarily reflect their knowledge or expertise. While eloquent speakers can be impressive, they can also be misleading.

With the rise of large language models, such as GPT-3, we have access to language that appears to be well-formed and logical. These models can produce complex sentences, construct compelling arguments, and even mimic human conversation. However, just because language is grammatically correct and sounds good does not mean that it is accurate or truthful.

The danger of relying on large language models is that they can perpetuate falsehoods and mislead people. In many cases, these models are trained on vast amounts of text data, including fake news and propaganda, which can result in them generating biased and misleading content.

> Therefore, it is important to recognise that **eloquence does not guarantee knowledge or expertise**. We should be critical of the information we receive, especially when it comes from sources that use complex language to appear knowledgeable or trustworthy. Instead, we should focus on the substance of what is being said, and evaluate information based on its accuracy, reliability, and credibility.

While we may be accustomed to associating weak speech with a lack of knowledge and expertise, and eloquent speech with education and expertise, this is not always the case. We need to be critical of the language we consume, especially with the rise of large language models, and focus on the substance of what is being said. By doing so, we can make informed decisions and avoid being misled by false or inaccurate information.
