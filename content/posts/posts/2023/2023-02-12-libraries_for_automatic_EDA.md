Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an important step in the data analysis process. It allows us to explore and understand the dataset, identify patterns, and make informed decisions about data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling. In recent years, several Python libraries have been developed to automate and streamline the EDA process. Here are 10 popular Python libraries for automated EDA:

## Top-10 Tools for Automated EDA

### Pandas Profiling
2. Pandas Profiling generates a report with descriptive statistics and visualizations for each variable in a Pandas DataFrame. The report includes correlations, missing values, and data types. [Link](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling)

## Honorable mentions
There are three other tools that might be useful during data exploration.

## Featuretools
Featuretools is a library for **automated feature engineering** that allows you to automatically generate features from multiple tables. It includes tools for handling time-based data and can generate a set of feature definitions in just a few lines of code. [Link](https://github.com/FeatureLabs/featuretools)
