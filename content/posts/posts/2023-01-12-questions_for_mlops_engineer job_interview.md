Machine learning has become an integral part of many industries, and as the use of machine learning models in production environments has increased, so has the need for MLOps (Machine Learning Operations). MLOps is a practice that combines the principles of DevOps with the unique requirements of machine learning to improve the speed, quality, and reliability of machine learning models in production.

As the demand for MLOps engineers continues to grow, it's essential for companies to have a solid understanding of the skills and knowledge required for this role. This post will provide a set of interview questions that can help you evaluate the qualifications of potential MLOps engineers. The questions cover a wide range of topics, including MLOps best practices, model deployment and management, data management and pipeline, monitoring and troubleshooting, and more.

Whether you're a hiring manager, a team lead, or an interviewer, these questions will help you identify the right candidates for your MLOps team and ensure that they have the skills and experience needed to succeed in this critical role.

Please find below set of 50 questions that can be used in the MLOps engineer job interview and 10 more for senior candidates.
