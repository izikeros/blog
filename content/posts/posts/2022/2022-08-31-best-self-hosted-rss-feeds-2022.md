## What is RSS
>
>**RSS** (**Really Simple Syndication**) is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitors sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them.
>
Websites usually use RSS feeds to publish frequently updated information, such as blog entries, news headlines, episodes of audio and video series, or for distributing podcasts. An RSS document (called "feed", "web feed", or "channel") includes full or summarized text, and metadata, like publishing date and author's name. RSS formats are specified using a generic XML file.

## Hackable RSS readers written in Python

If none of available feed readers meet you expectations you might want to customize existing one. There are few that are relatively simple and might be easier to build upon those. You can check the GitHub topic [feed-reader](https://github.com/topics/feed-reader?l=python) to explore  popular but not necessarily lightweight options written in python. For small, hackable tools check the options below.

### [microreader](https://github.com/morganbengtsson/microreader)

Very simple web based RSS/Atom feed reader. Written in python with bottle.
There is one python module with app logic, one file with models and module for handling fav icons. At the moment of writing las commit was from 2015.

### [spudooli-reader](https://github.com/spudooli/spudooli-reader)

**Features**

- A reasonably capable RSS feed parser - It even handles the inventor of RSS, Dave Winer's feed, although doesn't handles dates or timezones well as I ran out of skills
- A simple, easy to use, and easy to understand interface
- Star a feed item for later appreciation
- An about page and a reading list page to show everyone the scope of your intersts
- A basic admin to add/remove feeds
- Single user log in to keep your feed safe
- Basic code that allows you to follow along, if Flask isn't your thing

### [feedIO](https://github.com/seejay/feedIO)

"A News Aggregator that Knows What You Want to Read."

### [habr-observer](https://github.com/pltnk/habr-observer)

"An automatically updated feed with summaries of the best Habr.com articles generated by the YandexGPT neural network.""
Russian tool, to observe Russian tech news. Interesting thing is that is using Streamlit for UI and uses LLM for summarization.

## Library allowing you write own feed reader

When hacking you own feed reader you might take a look on [reader](https://github.com/lemon24/reader) which is a Python feed reader library. It is designed to allow writing feed reader applications without any business code, and without depending on a particular framework.
