# Top CLI tools that improve work in console in 2019

Here is a list of command line tools and Zsh plugins improving experience when working in text mode. List was created using resources from [Awesome Zsh plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins). The Github collection is called "Zsh plugins" but in fact it is not strictly limited to Zsh plugins but contains a lot of CLI tools that are not Zsh plugins. I have made already similar list 1.5 year ago - you can find results here: [top zsh plugins](http://safjan.com/articles/posts/top-popular-zsh-plugins-on-github).

On Github project [Awesome Zsh plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins) you can find currently 1700+ links to plugins, themes and Zsh plugin managers/frameworks. The collection grows in size and gets more and more intimidating for the reader. I decided to filter out tools that are most popular. The popularity is measured with the number of stars that Github users added to given plugin.

# What are Github stars?

Stars is the way how users can 'bookmark' projects - this can serve as indication for others that project successfully grabbed someone's attention. The `stargazers` statistics are available via [GithubAPI](https://developer.github.com/v4/). The metrics is not capturing directly how popular given tool is but I expect, it is a good indication of how well is grabbing attention of Github users. For sake of clarity, I have excluded frameworks, themes, prompts and fonts  that are also listed on "Awesome Zsh plugins" website. The most popular choices excluded from the tools list are posted in the end of this article.
