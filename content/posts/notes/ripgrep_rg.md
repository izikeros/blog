Notes on using ripgrep (rg) mainly for use cases as a Python developer working with .py, .ipynb, and .md files:

## Basic search
```sh
   rg "pattern" path/to/search
```

## Search only Python files
```sh
   rg --type py "pattern"
```

## Search Jupyter notebooks
```sh
   rg --type-add 'ipynb:*.ipynb' --type ipynb "pattern"
```

## Search Markdown files
```sh
   rg --type md "pattern"
```

## Case-insensitive search
```sh
   rg -i "pattern"
```

## Search for whole words
```sh
   rg -w "word"
```

Show context around matches
```sh
   rg -C 3 "pattern"  # 3 lines before and after
```

## Search for multiple patterns
```sh
   rg "pattern1|pattern2|pattern3"
```

Exclude specific directories:
```sh
   rg "pattern" --glob '!{venv,__pycache__}'
```

## Search for Python functions
```sh
    rg "def \w+\("
 ```

## Search for Markdown headers
```sh
    rg "^#{1,6} .+"
 ```

## Count matches
```sh
    rg -c "pattern"
 ```

## Display only the filenames where a pattern appears

To display only the filenames where a pattern appears, you can use the `-l` or `--files-with-matches` option in ripgrep. Here's how to do it:

```sh
rg -l "pattern"
```

## Search for files with a specific name pattern

`rg --files -g "*.py"`

## Use AND logic for multiple patterns:

`rg "pattern1" | rg "pattern2"`
