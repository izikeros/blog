## What devices can be used for self-hosting of private services?

There are a variety of devices that can be used for self-hosting private services, depending on the specific service and the user's needs. Some popular devices include:

- **Desktop computers**: Typically old PCs. These can be used to run a variety of services, such as file servers, media servers, and backup services. They typically have more storage and processing power than other devices, making them well-suited for running multiple services at once, however, they are consuming relatively more electrical energy than other options.

- **Single-board computers**: These are small, low-power devices that can be used to run a limited set of services. Some popular single-board computers include the Raspberry Pi, the Odroid, and the Arduino. They are very affordable, easy to use, and can be powered by a small power supply.

- **NAS (Network Attached Storage) devices**: These are specialized devices that are designed for storing and sharing files on a network. They typically come with a variety of built-in services, such as file sharing and backup. Some popular NAS devices include the [Synology](https://www.synology.com/) and the [QNAP](https://www.qnap.com/en-us).

- **Cloud-based services**: The last option that could be considered as self-hosted but all the data is not on your own premises. These are services that run on remote servers and can be accessed over the internet. Some popular cloud-based services include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. These can be used to host services remotely, with the added benefit of scalability and reliability.

It's important to note that the choice of device will depend on the specific service being run, the amount of resources required, and the user's technical expertise and budget.
