There are several alternative methods of packaging ML models, and the appropriate method will depend on the specific use case and requirements. Some alternative methods include:

### Complex models that have many dependencies, or for models that need to run on specific operating systems -> **Containers**
**Containers**, such as Docker, provide a way to package and distribute the entire runtime environment for a model, including the operating system, libraries, and dependencies. This can be useful for **complex models that have many dependencies, or for models that need to run on specific operating systems**.
    
### Models that have specific version requirements, or for reproducing a specific environment -> **Virtual environments**
Virtual environments, such as conda, provide a way to create isolated Python environments that include specific versions of libraries and dependencies. This can be useful for **models that have specific version requirements, or for reproducing a specific environment**.
    
### Models that need to be invoked on-demand or for models that have infrequent usage -> **Serverless**
Serverless computing, such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. This can be useful for **models that need to be invoked on-demand or for models that have infrequent usage**.

### Models that need to be deployed in a lightweight environment, or for models that need to run in low-resource devices -> **PEX**

PEX (Python Executable) is a way to package a Python application and all its dependencies into a single file, which can be run without a separate Python installation. This can be useful for **models that need to be deployed in a lightweight environment, or for models that need to run in low-resource devices**.

    
### Easy deploying, managing, and monitoring models, automatic scaling ->  **Cloud-based Platforms**
Some **cloud-based** platforms like AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud ML Engine, and Azure Machine Learning Studio **provide easy to use environment for deploying, managing, and monitoring ML models. They also provide automatic scaling, automatic patching, and other benefits.**
    
### Models that need to be integrated into existing systems -> **Wrapper or API**
Creating a **wrapper or API** around the model, which can be used to interact with the model via a web interface or an API. This can be useful for **models that need to be integrated into existing systems or for making the model accessible to non-technical users**.

Ultimately, the choice of packaging method will depend on the specific requirements of the model, the target audience, and the resources available. It's worth considering the trade-offs between different options and choosing the one that best fits your use case.
