<a id="marimo"></a>

## Marimo

A promising alternative to traditional Python notebooks, offering a refreshing approach to interactive programming with its emphasis on reactivity, reproducibility, and deployment versatility.

One of [Marimo](https://marimo.io/)'s standout qualities is its **deterministic execution order**. Unlike traditional notebooks where execution order can be influenced by cell position, Marimo organizes code execution based on variable references, enhancing clarity and predictability. Additionally, Marimo synchronizes UI elements such as sliders and dropdowns with corresponding code cells, facilitating interactive data exploration without cumbersome callbacks.

Moreover, Marimo prioritizes **reproducibility** and **shareability**, storing **notebooks as `.py` files**, which are friendly to version control systems like Git. This approach not only fosters collaboration but also streamlines the deployment of notebooks as pipelines or interactive web applications, extending their utility beyond mere experimentation.

Marimo's inspiration draws from a collective desire to reinvent Python notebooks into robust, interactive, and shareable programming environments. With influences from projects like [Pluto.jl](https://plutojl.org/) and [ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/), Marimo contributes to the ongoing evolution towards reactive dataflow programming, promising a better ecosystem for research, collaboration, and computational exploration.
