# Docstring examples in various styles
[Reference](http://queirozf.com/entries/python-docstrings-reference-examples)

# Support across the tools I use
## pyment
supports: "javadoc", "reST", "numpydoc", "google"
See: [Pyment](), [Python convert docstring styles](./python-convert-docstring-styles/)

## pdoc3
Currently, pure Markdown (with [extensions](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/#officially-supported-extensions), [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html), and [Google-style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) docstrings formats are supported, along with some reST directives.

## pycharm
supports the following styles for docstrings:

- plain (handwritten, no template or format enforcement)
- [epytext](http://folk.uio.no/inf3330/scripting/doc/python/epydoc/epytext.html)
- [reST](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html)
- [google](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example_google.html)
- [numpy](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example_numpy.html)


# Python Docstring conventions
## Google-style example
from: [Sphinx documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html)

```python
def fetch_smalltable_rows(table_handle: smalltable.Table,
                          keys: Sequence[Union[bytes, str]],
                          require_all_keys: bool = False,
) -> Mapping[bytes, Tuple[str]]:
    """Fetches rows from a Smalltable.

    Retrieves rows pertaining to the given keys from the Table instance
    represented by table_handle.  String keys will be UTF-8 encoded.

    Args:
        table_handle: An open smalltable.Table instance.
        keys: A sequence of strings representing the key of each table
          row to fetch.  String keys will be UTF-8 encoded.
        require_all_keys: If True only rows with values set for all keys will be
          returned.

    Returns:
        A dict mapping keys to the corresponding table row data
        fetched. Each row is represented as a tuple of strings. For
        example:

        {b'Serak': ('Rigel VII', 'Preparer'),
         b'Zim': ('Irk', 'Invader'),
         b'Lrrr': ('Omicron Persei 8', 'Emperor')}

        Returned keys are always bytes.  If a key from the keys argument is
        missing from the dictionary, then that row was not found in the
        table (and require_all_keys must have been False).

    Raises:
        IOError: An error occurred accessing the smalltable.

    Examples:
        Examples should be written in doctest format, and should illustrate how
        to use the function.

        >>> print([i for i in example_generator(4)])
        [0, 1, 2, 3]
    """
```

## Numpy-style example

from: [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)


```
"""Docstring for the example.py module.

Modules names should have short, all-lowercase names.  The module name may
have underscores if this improves readability.

Every module should have a docstring at the very top of the file.  The
module's docstring may extend over multiple lines.  If your docstring does
extend over multiple lines, the closing three quotation marks must be on
a line by itself, preferably preceded by a blank line.

"""
from __future__ import division, absolute_import, print_function

import os  # standard library imports first

# Do NOT import using *, e.g. from numpy import *
#
# Import the module using
#
#   import numpy
#
# instead or import individual functions as needed, e.g
#
#  from numpy import array, zeros
#
# If you prefer the use of abbreviated module names, we suggest the
# convention used by NumPy itself::

import numpy as np
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# These abbreviated names are not to be used in docstrings; users must
# be able to paste and execute docstrings after importing only the
# numpy module itself, unabbreviated.

```python

def foo(var1, var2, *args, long_var_name='hi', **kwargs):
    r"""Summarize the function in one line.

    Several sentences providing an extended description. Refer to
    variables using back-ticks, e.g. `var`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    var1 : array_like
        Array_like means all those objects -- lists, nested lists, etc. --
        that can be converted to an array.  We can also refer to
        variables like `var1`.
    var2 : int
        The type above can either refer to an actual Python type
        (e.g. ``int``), or describe the type of the variable in more
        detail, e.g. ``(N,) ndarray`` or ``array_like``.
    *args : iterable
        Other arguments.
    long_var_name : {'hi', 'ho'}, optional
        Choices in brackets, default first when optional.
    **kwargs : dict
        Keyword arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    type
        Explanation of anonymous return value of type ``type``.
    describe : type
        Explanation of return value named `describe`.
    out : type
        Explanation of `out`.
    type_without_description

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    only_seldom_used_keywords : type
        Explanation.
    common_parameters_listed_above : type
        Explanation.

    Raises
    ------
    BadException
        Because you shouldn't have done that.

    See Also
    --------
    numpy.array : Relationship (optional).
    numpy.ndarray : Relationship (optional), which could be fairly long, in
                    which case the line wraps here.
    numpy.dot, numpy.linalg.norm, numpy.eye

    Notes
    -----
    Notes about the implementation algorithm (if needed).

    This can have multiple paragraphs.

    You may include some math:

    .. math:: X(e^{j\omega } ) = x(n)e^{ - j\omega n}

    And even use a Greek symbol like :math:`\omega` inline.

    References
    ----------
    Cite the relevant literature, e.g. [1]_.  You may also cite these
    references in the notes section above.

       expert systems and adaptive co-kriging for environmental habitat

       and neural-network techniques," Computers & Geosciences, vol. 22,
       pp. 585-588, 1996.

    Examples
    --------
    These are written in doctest format, and should illustrate how to
    use the function.

    >>> a = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> print([x + 3 for x in a])
    [4, 5, 6]
    >>> print("a\nb")
