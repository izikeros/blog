The Federated Social Web manifesto is a call to action for all those who believe in the power of decentralized social networking. It is a declaration of principles and values that guide the development of a new kind of social web, one that is built on the principles of openness, decentralization, and user control.

We believe that the web should be a place where individuals can express themselves freely and connect with others without fear of censorship or surveillance. We believe that the web should be a platform for creativity, collaboration, and innovation, not a tool for centralized control and exploitation.

We recognize that the current state of social networking is dominated by a handful of large corporations who control vast amounts of personal data and wield enormous power over what content is seen and shared. This centralization of power is dangerous and undermines the core values of democracy and freedom of expression.

We reject the notion that social networking should be a walled garden, where users are locked into closed platforms and forced to surrender control of their data and identity. We believe that social networking should be a distributed network of interconnected platforms, where users can choose the services and features that best suit their needs, and where the power of decision-making is distributed across the network.

We believe that the Federated Social Web should be built on open standards and protocols, and that interoperability should be a key principle. Users should be able to communicate and share content seamlessly across different platforms, without the need for proprietary software or closed ecosystems.

We call on developers, designers, activists, and users to work together to create a new kind of social web, one that is owned and controlled by the people, not by corporations or governments. We believe that the Federated Social Web can be a powerful tool for social change, and that it can help to create a more just, democratic, and equitable society.

We acknowledge that building a decentralized social web will not be easy. It will require new technologies, new business models, and new ways of thinking about social networking. But we are committed to this vision, and we believe that with determination, creativity, and collaboration, we can build a better web for all.

We believe that the Federated Social Web should be guided by the following principles:

1.  Openness: The Federated Social Web should be built on open standards and protocols, and should be transparent and accessible to all.
    
2.  Decentralization: The Federated Social Web should be a distributed network of interconnected platforms, where users can choose the services and features that best suit their needs.
    
3.  Interoperability: The Federated Social Web should prioritize interoperability, so that users can communicate and share content seamlessly across different platforms.
    
4.  User Control: Users should have complete control over their data and identity, and should be able to choose how and with whom they share their information.
    
5.  Privacy: The Federated Social Web should prioritize privacy and security, and should be designed to protect users from surveillance, censorship, and other forms of online oppression.
    
6.  Accessibility: The Federated Social Web should be accessible to all, regardless of their location, language, or ability.
    
7.  Innovation: The Federated Social Web should be a platform for creativity, collaboration, and innovation, where new ideas can be shared and developed freely.
    

We believe that these principles can guide the development of a new kind of social web, one that is more democratic, more equitable, and more just. We call on all those who share this vision to join us in building a better web for all.
