When designing and organizing code, developers often face the dilemma of whether to keep a method as part of a class or refactor it into a standalone function. This decision can significantly impact the maintainability, readability, and reusability of the codebase. In particular, the choice between converting a method into a static method or a standalone function can have far-reaching consequences. While static methods can help encapsulate utility functions within a class, they still maintain a degree of coupling with the class. On the other hand, standalone functions offer greater flexibility, reusability, and testability, making them an attractive alternative for many scenarios. I will explore the factors that influence this decision and provide guidelines for determining when to refactor a method into a standalone function or mark it as a static method.

## TLDR

In Python, it is generally better to use standalone functions instead of static methods when the functionality can be used independently of any particular class.

## Why to use functions?

Here are some reasons why:

1. **Code organization**: Standalone functions can help keep your code organized by separating concerns. When you have a utility function that doesn't depend on any class-specific state or behavior, it makes sense to keep it separate from the class. This improves readability and maintainability.

2. **Code reuse**: Functions can be more easily reused across different modules and projects compared to static methods, which are tied to a specific class.

3. **Testing**: Functions are generally easier to test than static methods, as you don't need to create an instance of the class or worry about its state.

4. **Polymorphism**: Functions can be more easily replaced or mocked for testing or extension purposes, whereas static methods are more tightly coupled to the class.

5. **Documentation**: Functions can be documented using docstrings, which can be easily accessed using help() or third-party tools like Sphinx. Static methods can be documented, but their documentation might be less discoverable.

On the other hand, you might want to keep a method as a static method if:

- **It's closely related to the class**: If a method is closely related to the class and is used to provide additional functionality that's specific to the class, it's better to keep it as a static method.
- **It's used as a factory function**: If a method is used as a factory function to create instances of the class, it's better to keep it as a static method.

## Summary

when a method can be implemented and used independently of a class, consider refactoring it to a standalone function. This approach can lead to cleaner, more modular, and more maintainable code.
