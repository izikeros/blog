With [vectorbt](https://github.com/polakowo/vectorbt) you will find your trading edge, using the fastest engine for backtesting, algorithmic trading, and research. Optimized for speed - using matrix computations (NumPy) + acceleration of NumPy with Numba. 
Since it is fast when compared to other libraries, therefore it will be useful for:
- optimization (fast evaluation of the given set of parameters)
- large-scale sweeping of parameter space and visualizing as 2D heat map or 3D volume plot.

There is also a paid version, which is refactored with multiple enhancements over the free version.  The free version is maintained but no new features are added by the author:
>Yes, I still do smaller bug fixes and merge pull requests. But I won't develop any new features, everything is coming to vbt pro.
