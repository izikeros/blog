## Idea for the outline for learning Bayesian methods as a Data Scientist

1.  Begin by understanding the basic concepts of probability and Bayesian statistics. This includes understanding [probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution), [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem), and the concept of a [prior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability) and a [posterior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_probability).
2.  Learn about the different types of models used in Bayesian statistics, such as [conjugate priors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior) and [hierarchical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Bayesian_model).
3.  Learn about [Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) methods, which are a class of algorithms used to perform Bayesian inference. These include [Metropolis-Hastings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm), [Gibbs sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_sampling) and [Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo).
4.  Learn about [variational inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods), which is an alternative to MCMC that is useful for approximating Bayesian inference in large or complex models.
5.  Practice implementing Bayesian models using popular tools and software such as [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/), [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), and [Edward](http://edwardlib.org/).
6.  Get familiar with Bayesian deep learning frameworks such as [PyMC](https://docs.pymc.io/), [TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability), and [Edward2](https://github.com/google/edward2).
7.  Learn how to interpret and visualize the results of Bayesian models and perform [model comparison and selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_selection).
8.  Apply Bayesian methods to real-world data science problems and practice communicating the results to non-technical stakeholders.
9.  Read the literature and keep updated on the latest developments in Bayesian methods and the related field.
