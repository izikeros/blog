Table representation learning is an exciting field that focuses on understanding the structure and relationships within tabular data. This can involve **learning embeddings for individual columns** or **entire tables**, and can be used for various applications such as data discovery, data validation, and data integration.

One key aspect of table representation learning is **understanding the semantics of column**s, which can be used to **generate metadata** and help with tasks like **table comprehension** and **data discovery**.

By accurately representing columns and their relationships, table representation learning can help improve machine learning models and enable more complex analysis of tabular data.
