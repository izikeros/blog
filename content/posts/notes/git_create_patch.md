Title: In Git, How Create Patch for Changes Between Current Head and Given Commit?
---
To create a patch in Git for the changes between the current HEAD and a given commit, you can use the `git diff` command with the `--patch` option. Here are the steps:

1.  Get the hash of the commit you want to compare to the current HEAD by running `git log`.
    
2.  Run `git diff --patch <commit hash> HEAD > mypatch.patch`.
    
3.  This will create a patch file named `mypatch.patch` in the current directory.
    

The `git diff` command compares the specified commit to the current HEAD and generates a diff. The `--patch` option tells Git to output the diff in patch format. The `>` operator redirects the output to a file named `mypatch.patch`.

Note that the patch file will contain only the changes between the two commits, not the entire files. You can apply the patch by using the `git apply` command. For example, you can apply the patch with the following command:


```sh
git apply mypatch.patch
```

This will apply the changes from the patch to the current working directory. If there are any conflicts, Git will stop and ask you to resolve them manually. You can then commit the changes as usual.
