There are many powerful and lesser-known plotting libraries available in Python that can be used to create high-quality plots and visualizations. Some examples of these libraries include:

1.  HoloViews ([https://holoviews.org/gallery/index.html](https://holoviews.org/gallery/index.html)): A library that makes it easy to create and interact with data visualizations in Python, using a high-level interface.
    
2.  Bqplot ([https://bqplot.org/examples.html](https://bqplot.org/examples.html)): A 2D data visualization library based on the Jupyter interactive widget framework, which allows you to create interactive plots that can be easily embedded in notebooks.
    
3.  Plotly Dash ([https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/Portal/)): A library for creating interactive web-based plots and dashboards using Plotly, which allows you to create highly customizable and interactive plots.
    
4.  Geoplotlib ([http://www.geoplotlib.org/examples.html](http://www.geoplotlib.org/examples.html)): A library for creating geospatial visualizations, which can be used to create maps, choropleths, and other types of geospatial plots.
    
5.  Pygal ([https://pygal.org/en/stable/documentation/types/](https://pygal.org/en/stable/documentation/types/)): A library for creating SVG charts and graphs, which provides a wide range of chart types and a simple interface for creating interactive plots.
    
6.  Seaborn ([https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html)): A library for creating statistical plots and visualizations, which is built on top of matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating a wide range of plots.
    
7.  Vincent ([https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html)): A library for creating visualizations using the Vega visualization grammar, which allows you
