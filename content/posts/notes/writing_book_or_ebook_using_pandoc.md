## Introduction

Writing a book in Markdown format is a great way to simplify the process of creating a well-formatted document. Pandoc is a popular tool that can be used to convert Markdown files into a variety of other formats, including PDF, ePub, and HTML. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of creating a multi-chapter book in Markdown using Pandoc.

## Installing Pandoc

Before you can start using Pandoc, you need to install it on your computer. You can download the latest version of Pandoc from the official website ([https://pandoc.org/](https://pandoc.org/)). Once you have downloaded and installed Pandoc, you can start using it from the command line.

## Writing your book

Each chapter in your book should be saved in its own Markdown file. For example, your first chapter could be saved as "Chapter 1.md". You can use any text editor to write your book in Markdown format. Here is a sample Markdown file for a chapter in your book:

```
# Chapter 1: Introduction

This is the first chapter in our book. We will cover the basics of writing in Markdown and how to use Pandoc to convert our book into different formats.

## Section 1.1: Writing in Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. It uses a simple syntax to format text, including headings, lists, links, and images.

## Section 1.2: Using Pandoc

Pandoc is a powerful tool for converting files between different formats. With Pandoc, you can easily convert a Markdown file into a variety of other formats, including PDF, ePub, and HTML.

```

## Adding images and media

You can also add images and other media to your book. To include an image in your Markdown file, simply add the following syntax:

`![Alt Text](image.jpg)`

## Converting your book to PDF

To convert your book to PDF format, you need to use the following command in the terminal:

`pandoc -s -o book.pdf Chapter1.md Chapter2.md Chapter3.md ...`

This command tells Pandoc to create a new file called "book.pdf" using the source files "Chapter1.md", "Chapter2.md", and "Chapter3.md". The "-s" option tells Pandoc to use a standalone document structure, which is necessary for creating a book.

## Converting your book to ePub

To convert your book to ePub format, you need to use the following command in the terminal:

`pandoc -s -o book.epub Chapter1.md Chapter2.md Chapter3.md ...`

## Adding metadata

You can also add metadata to your book, such as the title, author, and date, by adding a YAML header to the beginning of each Markdown file. For example:

```yaml
---
title: Chapter 1: Introduction
author: John Doe
date: 2022-01-01
---

# Chapter 1: Introduction
...

```

## How to use styling when creating book with pandoc?

Pandoc supports several methods for applying custom styles to your book when converting from Markdown to other formats such as PDF or HTML. Here are some of the ways you can use styling when creating a book with Pandoc:

1. **CSS**: You can create a custom stylesheet in CSS and include it in your Pandoc conversion command. For example:

`pandoc -s -o book.pdf Chapter1.md Chapter2.md --css=styles.css`

2. **Templates**: Pandoc allows you to use custom templates to define the structure and style of the output document. To use a custom template, you can create a template file in the desired format (e.g. HTML or LaTeX) and include it in your Pandoc conversion command. For example:

`pandoc -s -o book.pdf Chapter1.md Chapter2.md --template=template.tex`

3. **Inline styles:** You can also add inline styles directly to your Markdown file. For example:

`This is a <span style="color: red;">red</span> text.`

4. **Pandoc filters:** Pandoc provides a way to apply custom modifications to the output document using filters. You can write a filter in a scripting language such as Python or Lua and use it in your Pandoc conversion command. For example:

`pandoc -s -o book.pdf Chapter1.md Chapter2.md --filter=filter.py`

Each of these methods has its own advantages and limitations, and the best approach depends on your specific requirements and preferences. It's also possible to use a combination of these methods to achieve the desired style for your book.
