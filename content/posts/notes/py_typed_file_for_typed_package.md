For the Python programming, type checking might be an important aspect aspect that ensures the correctness of your code. The `mypy` type checker is a powerful tool that uses type annotations to verify your code. However, it might not recognize the type hints provided by your package unless you include a `py.typed` file. This is a common oversight that can lead to incorrect package publishing.

## Understanding `py.typed`

**The `py.typed` file is a marker file that indicates to type checkers like `mypy` that your package comes with type annotations.** Without this file, the type checker won't use the type hints provided by your package, leading to potential type errors. This requirement is outlined in [PEP-561](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/#packaging-type-information) and the [mypy documentation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installed_packages.html#making-pep-561-compatible-packages).

## Adding `py.typed` to Your Package

Adding a `py.typed` file to your package is straightforward. Simply create a `py.typed` file in your package directory and include it in your distribution.

If you're using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), you can add the following lines under the `[tool.poetry]` section of `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
packages = [
  {include = "mypackage"},
  {include = "mypackage/py.typed"},
]
```

For those using `setup.py`, you can add `package_data` to the `setup` call:

```python
setup(
    package_data={"mypackage": ["py.typed"]},
)
```

After adding the `py.typed` file, release [a new version for your package](https://github.com/whtsky/pixelmatch-py/commit/9c6297cedd10232ffbe23cc54a4e46e76d1fa13a). This will ensure that the type information from your packages works as expected.

## Conclusion

If you're a Python package maintainer, don't forget to include a `py.typed` file in your typed package. This simple step can make a significant difference in ensuring the correctness of your code and the usability of your package. It's a small effort that goes a long way in maintaining the quality and reliability of your Python package.
