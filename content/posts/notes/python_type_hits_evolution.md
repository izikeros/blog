## The Mental Model

Python typing wasn’t born overnight. It crept into the language slowly, first as a loose suggestion and later as a core part of modern codebases.  
Originally, you could only hint types using comments (`# type: int`), but as Python matured, its typing syntax grew more expressive, more compact, and more powerful.

The journey started with **PEP 484** in **Python 3.5**, introducing the `typing` module and annotations as first-class citizens. Since then, nearly every minor version brought a refinement or simplification, allowing developers to express richer constraints without resorting to verbose generics.

```python
# Python 3.5 (PEP 484)
from typing import List

def greet_all(names: List[str]) -> None:
    for name in names:
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
````

This basic form of static typing opened the door for tools like **mypy**, **pyright**, **pylance** and most recently **ty**, **pyrefly** to provide editor-level correctness checks.

This basic form of static typing opened the door for tools like [**mypy**](https://mypy-lang.org/), [**pyright**](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright), [**pylance**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance), and most recently [**ty**](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/), [**pyrefly**](https://pyrefly.org/) to provide editor-level correctness checks.

## Key Features Through Versions

### Python 3.5 (PEP 484) — The Birth of Typing

Introduced the `typing` module:

- `List`, `Dict`, `Tuple`, `Optional`, `Union`
- `Callable`, `Any`, `TypeVar`, `Generic`
- Function annotations became official.

### Python 3.6 — Variable Annotations

You could finally type variables directly without using comments:

```python
name: str = "Alice"
scores: list[int] = [10, 20, 30]  # still needed `List[int]` before 3.9
```

Also introduced `typing.NamedTuple` and `typing.NewType`.

### Python 3.7 — Postponed Evaluation (PEP 563)

Type hints were treated as **strings** by default (via `from __future__ import annotations`), delaying their evaluation until runtime.  
This solved circular import issues and reduced overhead in function definitions.

### Python 3.8 — TypedDict and Literal Types

Added:

- `TypedDict` for describing dicts with specific key/value types.
- `Final` and `Literal` for immutability and constant values.
- `Protocol` (PEP 544) for structural subtyping.

```python
from typing import TypedDict, Literal

class Movie(TypedDict):
    title: str
    year: int

def rate_movie(rating: Literal["good", "bad"]) -> None:
    ...
```

### Python 3.9 — Built-in Generics (PEP 585)

This was a huge quality-of-life upgrade:  
`list[int]` replaced `List[int]`, `dict[str, int]` replaced `Dict[str, int]`.

```python
# Before
from typing import Dict
users: Dict[str, int]

# After
users: dict[str, int]
```

### Python 3.10 — Union Operator (PEP 604)

Simplified `Union` syntax using the `|` operator.

```python
# Before
def parse(data: Union[str, bytes]) -> None: ...

# After
def parse(data: str | bytes) -> None: ...
```

Also improved type narrowing in `match` statements (structural pattern matching).

### Python 3.11 — Self Type, Variadic Generics, TypedDict Enhancements

- `Self` for methods returning their own type (PEP 673).
- `TypeVarTuple` and `Unpack` for variadic generics (PEP 646).
- `NotRequired` and `Required` for `TypedDict` fields.

```python
from typing import Self

class Shape:
    def set_size(self, x: int) -> Self:
        self.x = x
        return self
```

### Python 3.12 — The `typing` Cleanup

Deprecated old-style generics (`List`, `Dict`, etc.).  
Introduced `TypeAliasType` (PEP 695) and made `type` annotations simpler:

```python
type Vector = list[float]  # clean, explicit alias
```

### Python 3.13 — No More `from __future__ import annotations`

Postponed evaluation of annotations is now **default**, removing one of the last confusing steps in typing setup.

## Useful Patterns

### Simplified Union Types

Readable and concise unions are now idiomatic:

```python
def load_data(source: str | Path) -> str: ...
```

### Structural Subtyping with Protocols

Protocol-based typing (instead of inheritance) allows flexible contracts:

```python
from typing import Protocol

class SupportsClose(Protocol):
    def close(self) -> None: ...

def cleanup(obj: SupportsClose) -> None:
    obj.close()
```

### TypedDict for JSON-like Data

Great for static checking of structured but dict-based data:

```python
class Config(TypedDict, total=False):
    host: str
    port: int
```

### Self Type for Fluent Interfaces

Commonly used in builder-style classes:

```python
class Query:
    def where(self, condition: str) -> Self:
        ...
    def execute(self) -> None:
        ...
```

Typing has moved from verbose and experimental to elegant and essential.  
Modern Python encourages typing as part of its design philosophy — readable, predictable, and expressive.
