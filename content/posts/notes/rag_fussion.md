In the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, a new technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is gaining prominence. This technique is designed to enhance a user's input by incorporating additional information from an external source. This supplementary data is then leveraged by the LLM to enrich the response it generates. In this blog post, we will delve deeper into the core concept of RAG-fusion, which revolves around multiple query generation and re-ranking of results.

## What is RAG-fusion?

The principle behind RAG-fusion is to generate multiple versions of the user's original query using a LLM, and then re-rank the results to select the most relevant answers.

For instance, the prompt template for this task might look something like this: "Generate multiple search queries related to: {original_query}", where `{original_query}` is a placeholder for the user's original query. This step enables the model to explore different perspectives and interpretations of the original query, thereby broadening the range of potential responses.

## Re-ranking: A Crucial Step

The next vital step in the RAG-fusion process is re-ranking. This step is critical in determining the most pertinent answers to the user's query. The re-ranking process, often referred to as Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), involves collecting ranked search outcomes from multiple strategies.

Each document is assigned a reciprocal rank score. These scores are then merged to create a new ranking. The underlying principle here is that documents that consistently appear in top positions across diverse search strategies are likely more pertinent and should, therefore, receive a higher rank in the consolidated result.

## Why RAG-fusion Matters?

It provides a boost to the LLM's ability to generate more accurate, contextually relevant responses. By considering multiple interpretations of the original query and re-ranking the results, it ensures that the model's output is as closely aligned with the user's intent as possible.

In conclusion, RAG-fusion might be a powerful technique that brings together the strengths of large language models and advanced information retrieval strategies. By employing multiple query generation and re-ranking, it takes a giant leap towards making AI-powered systems more responsive, accurate, and user-friendly. As we continue to explore and refine these techniques, we move closer to the goal of creating AI that can understand and interact with us in increasingly sophisticated ways.
