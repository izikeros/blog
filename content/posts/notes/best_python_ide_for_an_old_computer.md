Give me long text on What are the best python IDEs to be used on an old computer?

Python is one of the most widely used programming languages for a variety of applications such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more. Choosing the right integrated development environment (IDE) is essential for efficient and productive coding, especially if you have an older computer with limited resources. Here are some of the best Python IDEs that are suitable for older computers.

## Best IDEs
### 1.  IDLE 
IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) is a lightweight IDE that comes bundled with Python itself. It is a basic IDE that provides the essential features for coding, such as syntax highlighting, code folding, autocompletion, and debugging. Since IDLE is included with Python, it requires minimal setup and is easy to use, making it a great option for beginners or those with limited resources.
    
### 2.  Geany
Geany is a lightweight and fast IDE that is suitable for older computers. It supports a wide range of programming languages, including Python, and provides features such as code folding, syntax highlighting, and autocompletion.
