## Metrics and methods

<a id="1-code-coverage-metrics"></a>

### 1. Code Coverage Metrics

While not sufficient on its own, code coverage remains a fundamental metric. Track:

- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of executed lines
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of executed branches in control structures
- **Path Coverage**: Percentage of executed unique code paths

<a id="2-mutation-testing"></a>

### 2. Mutation Testing

This technique introduces small, random changes (mutations) to your code and verifies if tests catch these alterations. Tools like [mutmut]([boxed/mutmut: Mutation testing system (github.com)](https://github.com/boxed/mutmut)), [cosmic-ray](https://github.com/sixty-north/cosmic-ray), or [PITest](https://pitest.org/) can automate this process, revealing areas where tests might be insufficient or overly permissive.

<a id="3-cyclomatic-complexity-coverage"></a>

### 3. Cyclomatic Complexity Coverage

Measure how well your tests cover complex code paths. High cyclomatic complexity often indicates areas more prone to bugs that require thorough testing.

<a id="4-test-smell-detection"></a>

### 4. Test Smell Detection

Identify common issues in test code that might indicate poor quality:
- **Long Test Methods**: Overly long tests that are hard to understand and maintain
- **Test Duplication**: Similar or identical test logic in multiple places
- **Assertion Roulette**: Multiple assertions in a test without clear messages

<a id="5-assertion-density"></a>

### 5. Assertion Density

Calculate the ratio of assertions to lines of test code. A higher density often indicates more thorough testing, though this metric should be used cautiously as it can be manipulated.

<a id="6-test-execution-time"></a>

### 6. Test Execution Time

Monitor test execution time to maintain a balance between thoroughness and development speed.

<a id="7-flakiness-score"></a>

### 7. Flakiness Score

Track how often tests fail intermittently. Flaky tests can indicate poor test design or underlying code issues.

<a id="8-code-to-test-ratio"></a>

### 8. Code to Test Ratio

Compare the amount of production code to test code. While there's no universal ideal ratio, this can provide insights into under-tested areas.

<a id="9-test-coverage-of-critical-paths"></a>

### 9. Test Coverage of Critical Paths

Identify and ensure comprehensive testing of the most crucial workflows in your application. Implement risk-based testing to focus more efforts on high-risk or complex areas.

<a id="10-property-based-testing"></a>

### 10. Property-based Testing

Use tools like [Hypothesis](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis) to generate a wide range of inputs and test properties of your code, rather than specific examples.

<a id="11-static-analysis-integration"></a>

### 11. Static Analysis Integration

Combine unit test results with static analysis tools like [pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), or [mypy](https://www.mypy-lang.org/) to get a more comprehensive view of code quality and adherence to best practices.

<a id="12-mocking-coverage"></a>

### 12. Mocking Coverage

Assess how well your tests cover different scenarios when external dependencies are mocked.

<a id="13-test-suite-cohesion"></a>

### 13. Test Suite Cohesion

Analyze how changes in one part of the codebase affect test results in other parts, indicating how well your tests isolate functionality.

<a id="14-test-design-quality"></a>

### 14. Test Design Quality

Evaluate the design and readability of your tests:
- **Test Independence**: Ensure tests don't depend on each other
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names that state what is being tested
- [Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) Pattern](https://methodpoet.com/aaa-in-unit-testing/): Structure tests into clear setup, execution, and verification phases

<a id="15-behavior-driven-development-bdd"></a>

### 15. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

Adopt BDD practices to improve test coverage and clarity using tools like [Behave](https://github.com/behave/behave) or [pytest-bdd](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd).

<a id="16-test-metrics-and-reporting"></a>

### 16. Test Metrics and Reporting

Implement metrics and reporting to track and improve test quality:
- **Test Success Rate**: Measure the percentage of passing tests
- **Test Maintenance**: Track the effort needed to maintain and update tests
- **Coverage Trends**: Monitor code coverage over time to prevent degradation
