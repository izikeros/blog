> I created this library, because since version 2.9, PlWordNet cannot be easily loaded into Python (for example with `nltk`), as it is only provided in a custom `plwnxml` format.

General overview on how to use the Polish WordNet in Python:

1.  Download and install the Polish WordNet from the official website ([http://clarin-pl.eu/dspace/handle/11321/12](http://clarin-pl.eu/dspace/handle/11321/12)).
2.  Install the PyWordNet library in Python by running `pip install PyWordNet`.
3.  Import the PyWordNet library in your Python script.
4.  Load the Polish WordNet by calling the `WordNet` class from the PyWordNet library and passing the path to the downloaded WordNet database as a parameter.
5.  Once the WordNet is loaded, you can use the various functions provided by the PyWordNet library to perform operations such as searching for synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms, etc.
6.  You can also use the `synset` function to get the synset of a word, and then use functions such as `lemmas` and `definition` to get the details of the synset.

Here is an example of how to use the PyWordNet library to find synonyms of a word:

```python
from PyWordNet import WordNet

# Load the Polish WordNet
wn = WordNet('path/to/wordnet/database')

# Find synonyms of the word 'dog'
synonyms = wn.synonyms('biegać')

# Print the synonyms
print(synonyms)

```
Keep in mind that this is a very general overview and you may need to refer to PyWordNet library documentation and other resources to fully understand the usage and capabilities of the library.
