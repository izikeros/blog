Product Led Growth (PLG) is a business methodology in which the product itself serves as the primary driver of customer acquisition, conversion, and expansion. It's a model that prioritizes product usage as the key growth driver, rather than traditional marketing or sales efforts.

Here are some key points about Product Led Growth:

1. **User-Centric**: PLG focuses on the user experience. The product is designed to be so user-friendly and intuitive that it sells itself. The aim is to create a product that users love and can't live without.

2. **Viral Growth**: PLG often relies on viral growth. This means that current users recommend the product to others, creating a network effect. This can be facilitated by incorporating features that naturally encourage sharing or collaboration.

3. **Freemium or Free Trial Models**: Many PLG companies offer a freemium model or free trial to attract users. This allows users to try the product and see its value before deciding to pay for premium features.

4. **Self-Service**: PLG products are typically self-service, meaning users can sign up, use, and even upgrade the product without needing to interact with a sales team.

5. **Data-Driven**: PLG companies use data to understand user behavior, identify opportunities for improvement, and make informed decisions. They often use metrics like daily active users (DAU), monthly active users (MAU), and net promoter score (NPS) to measure success.

6. **Customer Success Focus**: In a PLG model, customer success is crucial. Companies need to ensure users are getting maximum value from the product, which often involves providing educational resources, responsive support, and regular product updates.

Examples of successful PLG companies include Slack, Dropbox, and Zoom. These companies have created products that users love, leading to rapid, organic growth.
