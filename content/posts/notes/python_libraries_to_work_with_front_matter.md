Prompt: What python packages can load and process yaml frontmatter in markdown documents (front matter is typically used in the markdown version of the article to publish). Please give me the long list with descriptions and links to Pypi and Git Hub (or another place where the code is stored). Give me a long blog post on that.

<a id="introduction"></a>
## Introduction
Markdown has gained popularity as a lightweight markup language for creating structured documents. It is widely used in various domains, including blogging, documentation, and note-taking. Markdown documents often include front matter, which is a metadata section at the beginning of the document. This front matter typically contains YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) formatted data that provides additional information about the document. In this blog post, we will explore several Python packages that can help you load and process YAML front matter in Markdown documents, providing you with the necessary tools to extract and work with this valuable metadata.

<a id="pyyaml"></a>
### PyYAML
PyYAML is a powerful YAML parser and emitter for Python. It allows you to easily read and write YAML files, making it a suitable choice for extracting YAML front matter from Markdown documents.

   - PyPI: [PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/)
   - GitHub: [PyYAML on GitHub](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml)

Example on how to load, modify and save front matter to markdown document:

```python
import yaml

# Read front matter from a Markdown file
with open('article.md', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    _, front_matter, _ = content.split('---', 2)
    data = yaml.safe_load(front_matter)

# Modify front matter
data['Modified'] = '2023-07-12'

# Write front matter back to the Markdown file
with open('article.md', 'w') as file:
    file.write('---\n')
    file.write(yaml.dump(data, default_flow_style=False))
    file.write('---\n')

```

<a id="frontmatter"></a>
### python-frontmatter
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)-style YAML front matter offers a useful way to add arbitrary, structured metadata to text documents, regardless of type.
This is a small package to load and parse files (or just text) with YAML (or JSON, TOML or other) front matter.

   - PyPI: [python-frontmatter](https://pypi.org/project/python-frontmatter/)
   - GitHub: [python-frontmatter on GitHub](https://github.com/eyeseast/python-frontmatter)

Example on how to load, modify and save front matter to markdown document:

```python
import frontmatter

# Read front matter from a Markdown file
post = frontmatter.load('article.md')

# Modify front matter
post['modified'] = '2023-07-12'

# Write front matter back to the Markdown file
frontmatter.dump(post, 'article.md')

```

<a id="python-markdown"></a>
### Python Markdown
Python Markdown is a popular package for parsing and rendering Markdown documents. While its primary focus is on converting Markdown to HTML, it also provides support for custom extensions, including front matter parsing.

   - PyPI: [Python Markdown](https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/)
   - GitHub: [Python Markdown on GitHub](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown)

Example on how to load, modify and save front matter to markdown document:

```python
from markdown.extensions import meta

# Read front matter from a Markdown file
with open('article.md', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    md = meta.MetaExtension()
    md.convert(content)

# Modify front matter
md.Meta['Modified'] = ['2023-07-12']

# Write front matter back to the Markdown file
with open('article.md', 'w') as file:
    file.write(md.Meta.pformat())
    file.write('\n---\n')
    file.write(md.body)

```

<a id="mistune"></a>
### mistune
Description: mistune is a fast and extensible Markdown parser implemented in pure Python. It aims to be compatible with the Markdown specification while offering various customization options, including support for front matter parsing.

   - PyPI: [mistune](https://pypi.org/project/mistune/)
   - GitHub: [mistune on GitHub](https://github.com/lepture/mistune)

Example on how to load, modify and save front matter to markdown document:

```python
import mistune

# Read front matter from a Markdown file
with open('article.md', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    md = mistune.Markdown(renderer=mistune.AstRenderer())

# Modify front matter
front_matter = md.renderer.front_matter

for node in md.parse(content):
    if isinstance(node, front_matter):
        node["Modified"] = "2023-07-12"

# Write front matter back to the Markdown file
with open('article.md', 'w') as file:
    file.write(md.renderer.render(md.parse(content)))

```

<a id="commonmark"></a>
### Commonmark
Commonmark is a comprehensive Markdown parsing and rendering library for Python. It adheres to the CommonMark specification and offers a wide range of features, including support for parsing YAML front matter.

   - PyPI: [Commonmark](https://pypi.org/project/commonmark/)
   - GitHub: [Commonmark on GitHub](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-python)

Example on how to load, modify and save front matter to markdown document:

```python
import commonmark
import re

# Read front matter from a Markdown file
with open('article.md', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()

# Extract front matter
front_matter = re.search(r'^---\n(.*?)\n---\n', content, re.DOTALL)
data = yaml.safe_load(front_matter.group(1))

# Modify front matter
data['Modified'] = '2023-07-12'

# Write front matter back to the Markdown file
with open('article.md', 'w') as file:
    file.write('---\n')
    file.write(yaml.dump(data, default_flow_style=False))
    file.write('---\n')
    file.write(content.replace(front_matter.group(0), ''))

```
