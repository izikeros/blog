## general advices on formulating prompts
> Give me the long text on formulating the prompts to you. What are the most effective ways to formulate prompts? To better understand illustrate rules with examples of good and bad prompts.


Formulating effective prompts to AI language models like ChatGPT is important in getting accurate and relevant answers. Here are some guidelines to help you create effective prompts:

1.  Be Clear and Specific: A clear and specific prompt helps the model understand what you are looking for. For example, "What are the causes of climate change?" is a clear and specific prompt.
    
2.  Use Complete Sentences: Complete sentences help the model understand the context and meaning of your request. For example, "Can you explain how photosynthesis works?" is a complete sentence.
    
3.  Avoid Ambiguous Words: Ambiguous words can lead to misunderstandings. For example, "What is it?" is an ambiguous prompt.
    
4.  Provide Enough Context: Providing context helps the model understand your request in the context of a broader topic. For example, "What is the history of the American Civil War?" provides context.
    
5.  Avoid Asking Multiple Questions in One Prompt: Asking multiple questions in one prompt can make it difficult for the model to determine what you are asking. For example, "What is the capital of France and what is its population?" is a prompt that asks two separate questions.
    

By following these guidelines, you can help ensure that the model provides you with accurate and relevant answers.

Examples of good prompts:

-   "What is the difference between socialism and capitalism?"
-   "Can you explain the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin?"
-   "What are the main causes of the Great Depression?"

Examples of bad prompts:

-   "capital France population?"
-   "evolution Darwin?"
-   "what it?"

Note: Keep in mind that even with well-formulated prompts, AI language models like ChatGPT are not perfect and may not always provide the most accurate or complete information.

## types of prompts
> If you would be asked to provide detailed typology of the prompts seen from your perspective how it would look like? In other words What types of prompts can you distinguish and name them. Give me long answer.

From the perspective of an AI language model like ChatGPT, there are several types of prompts that can be distinguished:

1.  Factual Questions: These prompts ask for information that can be verified and answered with a specific fact. For example, "What is the capital of France?" or "When was the first moon landing?"
    
2.  Explanatory Questions: These prompts ask for explanations of concepts or phenomena. For example, "Can you explain how a solar cell works?" or "What causes a volcanic eruption?"
    
3.  Opinion Questions: These prompts ask for personal opinions or beliefs. For example, "Do you think that AI will take over jobs in the future?" or "What is your opinion on climate change?"
    
4.  Comparison Questions: These prompts ask for comparisons between two or more things. For example, "What is the difference between socialism and capitalism?" or "Which is better, public or private schools?"
    
5.  Definition Questions: These prompts ask for the definition of a word or concept. For example, "What is a black hole?" or "Define democracy."
    
6.  Conversational Questions: These prompts are designed to start or continue a conversation on a particular topic. For example, "What do you like to do in your free time?" or "What was your most memorable experience?"
    
7.  Command Prompts: These prompts give a direct command or instruction to the AI model. For example, "Generate a poem about love." or "Translate this sentence into Spanish."
    
8.  Problem-Solving Prompts: These prompts ask the AI model to solve a problem or answer a question that requires analysis and critical thinking. For example, "What is the most efficient way to reduce carbon emissions?" or "How can we improve public transportation in cities?"
    

It is important to note that these typologies are not mutually exclusive and a single prompt can belong to multiple categories. Additionally, the effectiveness of a prompt will depend on the specific use case and the context in which it is used.
