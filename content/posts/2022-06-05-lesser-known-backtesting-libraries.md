summary: Sometimes input for document processing tasks such as OCR, table detection or text segmentation can be scanned or photo taken from hand that do not have ideal perspective - is rotated or spatially distorted in some way (warped document). If you are looking for my recommendations go straight to the last section of this article "Summary and recommendations".
