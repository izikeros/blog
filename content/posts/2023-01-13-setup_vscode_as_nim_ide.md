## Introduction
[Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) is a statically-typed, imperative programming language that is designed to be efficient, expressive, and easy to learn. It is often compared to other programming languages like Python, C, and Go. One of the great things about Nim is that it can be used to create efficient command-line tools, web servers, and desktop applications.

In this tutorial, we will go over how to set up [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code) as a Nim IDE (Integrated Development Environment) from scratch. This includes downloading VSCode, installing the Nim extension, and configuring the necessary settings for debugging and code completion.

## Installation steps
<a id="1-download-and-install-vscode"></a>
### 1. Download and Install VSCode
The first step is to download and install VSCode. You can do this by visiting the VSCode website ([https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) and selecting the appropriate download for your operating system. Once the download is complete, simply follow the instructions to install VSCode on your computer.

<a id="2-install-the-nim-extension"></a>
### 2 Install the Nim Extension
Once VSCode is installed, open it and press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+X</kbd> (<kbd>Cmd+Shift+X</kbd> on Mac) to open the Extensions pane. Search for "Nim" and select the "Nim" extension by "pragmagic" and click on the install button. This extension provides syntax highlighting, code completion, and other features for Nim development.

### 3. Configure the Settings
Now that the Nim extension is installed, you can configure the settings to make your Nim development experience even better. In VSCode, go to `File > Preferences > Settings` and search for "Nim". From here, you can configure settings such as the path to the Nim compiler, the formatting of the code, and the behavior of the code completion.

### 4. Download Nim
You will also have to download the Nim compiler, which you can do from the official website ([https://nim-lang.org/install.html](https://nim-lang.org/install.html)). Once downloaded, you can add the bin path of the Nim compiler to your environment variable.

### 5. Create a new Nim file
Now that everything is set up, you can create a new Nim file by going to `File > New File` and then saving the file with a `.nim` file extension. You can now start writing Nim code, and use the features provided by the extension such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging.

<a id="6-debugging"></a>
### 6. Debugging
VSCode provides an inbuilt debugging feature, you can use it for debugging your Nim code. You can use the <kbd>F5</kbd> key to start debugging, and the extension also provides support for breakpoints and watch variables.

<a id="conclusion"></a>
## Conclusion
In conclusion, setting up VSCode as a Nim IDE is relatively easy, and provides a great development experience. The Nim extension provides a wide range of features that make Nim development much more efficient and enjoyable. For more information on debugging in VSCode, you can refer to the official documentation ([https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)).
