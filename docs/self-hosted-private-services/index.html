These services allow users to encrypt their internet connection and access their home network from remote locations.</p>
<p>It is important to note that self-hosting can require a certain level of technical expertise and ongoing maintenance.</p>
<p><a id="services-that-getting-popularity-for-self-hosting"></a></p>
<h2>Services that getting popularity for self-hosting</h2>
<p>There are a few private services that are gaining attention or are envisioned to be very popular in the future that were not mentioned above. These include:</p>
<p><a id="personal-finance"></a></p>

<p>It is worth noting that these services are still relatively niche and may require more technical expertise to set up and maintain than more established self-hosted services.</p>
<p><a id="what-devices-can-be-used-for-self-hosting-of-private-services"></a></p>
<h2>What devices can be used for self-hosting of private services?</h2>
<p>There are a variety of devices that can be used for self-hosting private services, depending on the specific service and the user's needs. Some popular devices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Desktop computers</strong>: Typically old PCs. These can be used to run a variety of services, such as file servers, media servers, and backup services. They typically have more storage and processing power than other devices, making them well-suited for running multiple services at once, however, they are consuming relatively more electrical energy than other options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Single-board computers</strong>: These are small, low-power devices that can be used to run a limited set of services. Some popular single-board computers include the Raspberry Pi, the Odroid, and the Arduino. They are very affordable, easy to use, and can be powered by a small power supply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NAS (Network Attached Storage) devices</strong>: These are specialized devices that are designed for storing and sharing files on a network. They typically come with a variety of built-in services, such as file sharing and backup. Some popular NAS devices include the <a href="https://www.synology.com/">Synology</a> and the <a href="https://www.qnap.com/en-us">QNAP</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloud-based services</strong>: The last option that could be considered as self-hosted but all the data is not on your own premises. These are services that run on remote servers and can be accessed over the internet. Some popular cloud-based services include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. These can be used to host services remotely, with the added benefit of scalability and reliability. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to note that the choice of device will depend on the specific service being run, the amount of resources required, and the user's technical expertise and budget.</p>
